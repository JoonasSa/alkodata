## Alko's monthly sales and weather in Finland


# The research idea
We are trying to find out if there is any correlation between weather, holidays and Alko’s alcohol sales. If such a correlation exists we will try to predict next years sales.

# Predictions
We think it is likely that certain types of beverage sales are seasonal, meaning that weather will have an impact on the sales. Also it seems likely that the consumption of cheaper alcohols e.g. beers doesn’t vary a lot because of external conditions. 

# Analysis and data
Our data set is from Alko’s public monthly sales data from 03/2013 to 09/2017 and from Finnish Meteorological Institution’s open source weather data. A problem presented itself as Alko’s sales data was given only on a monthly basis. It would have been more useful if we had had data on the daily sales or at least on the weekly sales. Then we would have been able to achieve more accurate results. It would have also helped us to isolate the effect of seasonal holidays like New year's eve and First of May on Alko’s sales. We found collecting weather data somewhat challenging because weather data was not uniformly available to all places in Finland. We gathered our weather data from four cities that had enough data available and that were in different parts of Finland. This made it possible to calculate the average weather for each month in Finland.

# Results
Overall there is seems to be a correlation between overall sales and weather. For some beverages the effects are very obvious and for some the sales are almost constant. For example vodka and other strong spirits sell almost the same amount each month of year. December has a small spike in sales, but that is true for pretty much everything sold in Alko. During certain seasonal holidays (Christmas, New Years, May day, Midsummer day) Alko’s sales are strongly heightened. In summer there is more sales than during the other seasons. This is most likely caused by the increased temperature and/or the summer holiday season. The data points to the summer holidays, because there was little correlation with average temperature and the sales.

# Conclusion
These results might be useful to corporations that own bars, pubs or restaurants. They could use their sales data and weather forecasts to predict approximately how much beverage sales they are going to have in the future. This information could be used to create discounts for products that are going to sell poorly or to pick the correct “throw-in” products for the night. Also having data on sales beforehand would make it easier to have everything in stock.
